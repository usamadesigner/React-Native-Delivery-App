# DeliveryApplication

Our Project is basically based on Versatile Products delivery system which will be like random deliveries from one place to another instead of any Specific mean, it will be managed by people for people.

Abstract
Our project emphasizes on problems solving method which currently includes people managing their daily hundreds of possible problems of exchanging different things from one place to another which can be said as a Delivery of their own belongings in more efficient way but to be more precise, we are building an application which will a totally within public. We will be not having any kind of interference in their things but it will be managed by the people for the people.

Clear Statement of the Problem
Nowadays delivering something from one place to another cost too much because we have to use a specific platform for that such as TCS or DHL, we have to go to a particular place to book our packages. So we are solving this problem by developing a platform where people will upload their packages to be delivered and other people who are going through their routes and manages those deliveries with extra money they can earn without specifically going for it.
Now if someone forgets something during his trip, he can post his belonging on our application and someone who will be coming along that route will pick it up and delivered straight to him.

Objectives
•	To Build the most accessible and ease of use platform for generic people who travel and forget their belonging somewhere.
•	A system which will be fully controlled by the public without any third party interference.
•	Creating Interaction among different people.
•	Generating a part-time source of Income. 

Motivation
1.	We went through a lot during the COVID-19 in which we had an idea of developing an application which will remotely deliver us grocery items from our closest stores just because people were afraid of going out. Unfortunately, we could not implement it so we thought of generalizing it into a new and better Project.
2.	It’s interesting because it favors those who got no convenience to deliver or bring their stuff to particular places without using the specific means to do so.	
3.	It’s Important because we are generating perfect earning platform for public who can earn whenever they are in need of money.
4.	There is no limitation in working on this Platform. You can work whenever you want thus you are the master of your own life.

Introduction and Background
Considering the harsh conditions of today’s world who doesn’t like to have delivered their things on time in a best way possible. We are human living our life’s every day in greed of success during which we forget a lot of things ,so as among the race we are doing our part by developing something which could ease our life for us. Before finalizing this project, we went through some difficult choices like should we present our idea in a generalize manner or a specific manner because targeting a specific field of interest scale out some other people who got different problems. If we take a look in Amazon (World’s biggest online Retailers), Jeff Bezos pays 10 Billion dollars every month to its employees so people can get their package in as less in 2 days. So basically he targets customer satisfaction for his own greater good. So keeping it in mind we decided to build a new market where people can trade, deliver their possessions with each other without any specific mean of deliverance.
